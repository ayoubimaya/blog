## About
[Hummus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hummus) is a Middle Eastern dip made from chickpeas, tahini, lemon, and spices. It can be found in many grocery stores in North America and Europe, but it's so easy and fast to make that I recommend making your own! Here, I throw a curve ball and add some yogurt to add richness and parsley for some color. 

*Serving Size 5-6*

## Ingredients
- 15 oz can of garbanzo beans
- 3 tablespoons freshly squeezed lemon juice
- 2 medium size garlic cloves, minced
- 1 tablespoon tahini
- 1 tablespoon whole milk plain yogurt
- 1 1/2 teaspoon salt
- 1 tablespoon olive oil
- Powdered sumac or smoked paprika (optional)
- Handful of parsley (optional)

## Instructions
**1.** Open chickpeas and pour them and their juices in a bowl, and place in microwave for 4 minutes. Microwaving will help cut down on the gassy properties! 

**2.** Place chickpeas in the bowl of a food processor without their juices along with the garlic, salt, lemon juice, tahini, parsley, and yogurt. Process for 20 to 30 seconds.

**3.** Check to see if hummus is smooth. If dry, pour some of the reserved chickpea water and process for another 15 seconds. Add more water if needed.

**4.** Transfer the hummus to a bowl, drizzle olive oil, and sprinkle with sumac or smoked paprika and enjoy!
