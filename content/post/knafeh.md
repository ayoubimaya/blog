## About
[Knafeh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kanafeh), an amazing Middle Eastern dessert made with thin shredded filo noodles (or semolina dough), sweet cheese, clotted cream, or nut filling, and soaked in a sugar based syrup.

I've always loved knafeh growing up, but as a vegan teenager I needed to find a way to make a dairy free kind. But how? with coconut milk, of course! Years later with my veganism behind me, I still find myself preferring my vegan recipe over the traditional cheese knafeh. I'll be showing how to make 3 varieties of knafeh (sweet cheese, ashta, and vegan coconut milk filling). 

*Serving Size 10-12*
